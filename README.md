## Overview

The challenges are designed to be realistic projects that offer practical experience.
 emphasising the platform's role in skill development through real-world coding projects.


### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I've learned how to link a favicon to my HTML page. By using the `<link>` element within the `<head>` section and specifying the "shortcut icon" relationship, I can provide a small, recognizable icon that appears in the browser's tab or bookmarks, enhancing the user experience.

And I also  learned about "box-sizing" in CSS, which is a property used to control how the total width and height of an element are calculated. It allows you to specify whether an element's padding and border should be included in its dimensions or not, helping with layout and design control.

see below:

```html
```<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">

```css
Main {
 box-shadow: 0 1.6em 1.6em hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.05);
}
```
